Implement Agents and Environments. (Chapters 1-2)

The class hierarchies are as follows:

Thing ## A physical object that can exist in an environment
    Agent
        Wumpus
    Dirt
    Wall
    ...

Environment ## An environment holds objects, runs simulations
    XYEnvironment
        VacuumEnvironment
        WumpusEnvironment

An agent program is a callable instance, taking percepts and choosing actions
    SimpleReflexAgentProgram
    ...

EnvGUI ## A window with a graphical representation of the Environment

EnvToolbar ## contains buttons for controlling EnvGUI

EnvCanvas ## Canvas to display the environment of an EnvGUI
